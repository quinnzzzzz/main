or https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-1/main/blob/master/docs/ContactUs.adoc[contact us] directly.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/VolunCHeer/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/VolunCHeer/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.Voluncheer.MainApp`
. Enter your password. (Default password: password)
. Try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/VolunCHeer/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteVolunteer 1`.

.Component interactions for `deleteVolunteer 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/VolunCHeer/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/VolunCHeer/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/VolunCHeer/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `VolunCHeerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a volunteer).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Volunteer Book, Beneficiary Book, Project Book data.
* manages the interaction and relationship between different objects (Volunteer, Beneficiary, Project)
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Object>` that can be 'observed' (Object can be Vounteer, Beneficiary, Project). e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the VolunCHeer Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.voluncheerbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::Project[]
=== Project Complete Feature
The complete feature allows users to indicate a project as completed.

==== Implementation
To facilitate the complete feature, an association with a new `Complete` class is added to the `Project` class:

.Structure of the attributes of a Project in the Model component.
image::ProjectClassDiagram.PNG[width="800"]


The diagram shows that the Project class is associated with the Complete class.

The following sequence diagram shows how the complete command works:

.Figure Sequence diagram for the complete command.
image::CompleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


1.	The CompleteCommandParser parses the user input to obtain the target project index and constructs a ne CompleteCommand with this index.
2.	The logic portion of the complete command will be executed by the CompleteCommand method. To mark a Project object as complete:
i.  The CompleteCommand() method creates a targetProject based on the provided project index.
i. In the executeCommandResult() method then creates a editedProject with Complete attribute set to “true”.
    The editedProject is created with ProjectBuilder as shown below:

    Project editedProject = newProjectBuilder(targetProject).withComplete(true).build();

3.	In the executeCommandResult() method

    model.setProject(targetProject, editedProject)

is called to replace Project’s complete attribute from “false” to “true” in the VolunCHeer in-memory.

==== Design Considerations
[width="100%", cols="1, 1, 1 "options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternatives | Pros (+)/ Cons(-)
.2+| Implementation of ‘CompleteCommand’
| *Add a Complete attribute to Project (current choice)
   -Completed projects indicated “Red”*
| + : It is easy to tag complete status as an attribute to the project as we can make use of current implementations
such as model.setProject(Project,Project) that sets the project’s complete attribute to “true”. +
    {empty} +
 - :  Unable to have a observable list of complete projects.
| Create a new CompletedProjectList that consists of all the complete projects, a listComplete command to show all completed tasks..
| + : Will use less memory (e.g. for deleteVolunteer, just save the volunteer being deleted).
    {empty} +
  - : We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
|=======================================================================

=== Assign Feature
==== Implementations

// end::Project[]

// tag::BeneficiaryManagement[]
=== Beneficiary Management Feature
==== Implementation
Beneficiary is implement in order to manage the information a benefited volunteer organization. These organizations interact
with the user's organization through projects. Hence, `Beneficiary` class has a bidirectional navigability with `Project` class,
as shown in the Figure 8.

.Structure of the `Beneficiary` class including its attributes, and its bidirectional navigability with `Project` class.
image::BeneficiaryClassDiagram.jpg[width="800"]


This means that if an operation such as deletion is done on a beneficiary, this should be updated on the projects that the
beneficiary is assigned to. The figure below shows how the delete beneficiary command works:

.Beneficiary deletion sequence diagram, hard deletion mode.
image::BeneficiaryHardDeletionSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The `DeleteBeneficiaryParser` parses the index of the beneficiary that is required to delete.

//tag::ValidatePassword
=== Password Feature
==== Current Implementation
A password is required to grant access to the project manager at the start of the program.
It serves as a security mechanism to
protect the important data within.

At the start of the program, the UI is initialised by `UiManager`. A password window will pop out and prompt the user
to enter the password. +

.Program prompting user for password
image::password prompt.jpg[width="800"]

The password feature uses `ValidatePassword` to check if the user input matches the password stored in the program.
If the password matches, it will set boolean `user` to be true. `UiManager` will thus instantiate
 `fillInnerParts()`, displaying the hidden data to the project manager.

.Data displayed to user upon entering the correct password
image::login successful.jpg[width="800"]

If the password is entered incorrectly for five times, the program will terminate itself.

A sequence diagram is shown below to illustrate how it works in an abstract level.

.Sequence diagram of Password Feature
image::ArchitectureDiagram_password.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Login fields for password protection

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: UI with a password field.
** Pros: It is simple and user friendly. It serves its purpose as a offline application for a single user.
** Cons: The current alternative does not allow the user to change password.

* **Alternative 2**: Using CLI 

// tag::[recommendationCommandLine][]
=== [Proposed] Command Line Recommendation feature
==== Proposed Implementation
The command line recommendation feature is facilitated by the `CommandLineParser`. It imports the 'CliSyntax.Java'
and stores internally the `UserClosestInput` and `CommandUsed`. It updates the `UserClosestInput` and process to
give suggestions.
+
[NOTE]
"-D" indicates that the deletion is in
the hard mode, meaning that the respective projects that are attached to this beneficiary will be deleted.
+
. The `ModelManager` is then called to update the deletion of the respective projects.
. The `ModelManager` is then called to update the deletion of the beneficiary and update all the changes.

The summarised statistics information of beneficiary based on their activeness is generated by using the summarised command.

[NOTE]
The activeness of a beneficiary is measured by the number of projects that beneficiary has collaborated with the user's organization


The sequence diagram below shows how the summarise command works.

.Summarise beneficiary command sequence diagram.
image::SummaryBeneficiaryCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width=800]

. `SummaryBeneficiaryCommand` calls the `Model` to get the beneficiary list.
. A summary list is generated and passed to `Logic`.
. The Ui component which is `MainWindow` does handling of summarised list by generate a summary table and show on the screen.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How often should the `UserClosestInput` refresh itself
[width="100%", cols="1, 1, 1 "options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternatives | Pros (+)/ Cons(-)
.2+| Implementation of Synchronization
| *Update the by linear search for designed object*
| + : It is easier to implement because the code base are list based. Moreover, the use of the application is limited to only local
use without a large amount of data. Hence, this method gives a good performance in the context. +
    {empty} +
 - : Unoptimized in terms of complexity, which requires more work for scaling of the application.
| Hash Table of the data
| + : It has a better time complexity and reduce the work in scaling stage since this data structure is more optimized (O(1) can be achieved). +
  {empty} +
  - : Take more resources to implement.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Everytime the [space] key is used.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Unable to dynamicay support the user.
* **Alternative 2:** Every time a new character is type.
** Pros: Very dynamic in the UI and supporting the user.
** Cons: Potential to cause lagging, harder to implement.
.2+| Display and use of attached project list
| The beneficiary card shows the list
| + : The synchronization can be observed throughout the execution of commands. +
    {empty} +
 - : The beneficiary card is full with information and not reader friendly. Moreover, it is unnecessary to see the projects when operating single operations such as add, and edit

| *Generation of summary table*
| + : The summary gives a good way to look at the statistics of the beneficiary list. As it allows the dynamic of sorting in ascending or descending order
of the list based on the beneficiary's activeness +
  {empty} +
  - : The adaptation of Ui is required.


|=======================================================================
// end::BeneficiaryManagement[]

// tag::filterexport[]
=== Filtered Export feature
==== Current Implementation

To facilitate the filtering mechanism, a new `points` integer field is added to the `Volunteer` class:

.Volunteer class with new points field
image::Volunteerclasswithpoints.jpg[width="800"]

`points` was implemented as a integer instead of a class for ease of access. Also, it is not directly influenced by
any input from the user, as input has been checked by the the other classes in `Volunteer`. Hence, no accompanying
methods are necessary.

This feature revolves around 3 commands:

. `map` Command
. `sort` Command
. `exportV` Command

For the `map` command, the user inputs the specific criteria to map `Volunteers` on, as well as the points.
Upon execution of the `map` command, the following sequence diagram shows how the map command works:

.Sequence diagram of the map command
image::MapSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

`MapCommandParser` will check the given arguments for correctness, such as proper points or valid comparator.
It then creates a `MapObject` and stores the given arguments in a `Pair` of <points, conditions> and passes it to `MapCommand`, which passes it to `Model`
by calling `mapAllVolunteers`.

Within the model, `mapAllVolunteers()` is as shown:
----
public void mapAllVolunteer(MapObject map) {
        versionedAddressBook.getVolunteerList().forEach(volunteer -> {
            volunteer.resetPoints();
            volunteer.addPoints(checkAge(map, volunteer));
            volunteer.addPoints(checkRace(map, volunteer));
            volunteer.addPoints(checkRace(map, volunteer));
        });
    }
----
The `checkAge`, `checkRace` and `checkRace` methods check each `Volunteer` and
return the given points for that criteria,
which `addPoints` adds to them.

[large]*`Sort` Command*

For the `Sort` command, the `Model` calls the `UniqueVolunteerList` internal `sortByPoints` method.
This method uses the standard `FXCollections.sort` on the `internalList`,
which immediately reflects in the UI.
----
    public void sortByPoints() {
        FXCollections.sort(internalList, (new Comparator<Volunteer>() {
            public int compare (Volunteer s1, Volunteer s2) {
                return s2.getPoints() - s1.getPoints();
            }
        }));
    }
----
The custom comparator sorts `Volunteers` in descending order of points.


[large]*`Export` Command*

The `exportV` command writes certain parts of volunteers data based on provided crtieria.
It takes on various parameters such as [NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS],
[PREFIX OF DATA REQUIRED 1][PREFIX OF DATA REQUIRED 2] ... .

The `ExportVolunteerCommandParser` checks that at least 1 type of data and the number of `Volunteers`
is given. It then stores the prefixes in a list called `prefixToBePrinted` and returns the the list and the number of volunteers
as a `Pair` to `ExportVolunteer`.
The code snippet below shows how the main command is implemented.
----
File output = new File("Export.csv");
        List<String[]> volunteerData = new ArrayList<>();
        volunteerData = model.addData(numVolunteers, prefixToBePrinted);
        try (PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(output)) {
            volunteerData.stream()
                    .map(this::toCsv)
                    .forEach(pw::println);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new CommandException("Error writing to file");
        }
----
A `List` of `String` arrays is used to store each line of `Volunteer`. The `addData` method goes through the `Volunteer`
list and collects the specified fields into a `String` array, which is appended to another `List` of `String` arrays
and returned. The `toCsv` method formats the data into CSV-friendly data.

Below are certain considerations made when designing the filtered export feature.

[width="100%", cols="1, 1, 1 "options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternatives | Pros (+)/ Cons(-)
.1+| Sorting the internal volunteer list
| *Using a SortedList wrapper around the unmodifiable list*
| + : Easy to implement. + Will not affect the actual data.
    {empty} +
 - :  The new SortedList has to be added to the UI, or constantly swapped around with
 the usual list of volunteers.

.1+| Using PrintWriter to write out data to CSV
| *Using an open-source library such as openCSV to handle the writing.*
| + : Easier to understand and code for any new developers. + openCSV will handle special characters in data.
    {empty} +
 - : External library is required to be installed. - Data to be written is already checked and cleaned to be free of
 special characters, hence it is not necessary.


|=======================================================================


// end::filterexport[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedVolunCHeer`.
It extends `VolunCHeer` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `voluncheerBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedVolunCHeer#commit()` -- Saves the current VolunCHeer book state in its history.
* `VersionedVolunCHeer#undo()` -- Restores the previous VolunCHeer book state from its history.
* `VersionedVolunCHeer#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone VolunCHeer book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitVolunCHeer()`, `Model#undoVolunCHeer()` and `Model#redoVolunCHeer()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedVolunCHeer` will be initialized with the initial VolunCHeer book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single VolunCHeer book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `deleteVolunteer 5` command to delete the 5th Volunteer in the VolunCHeer book. The `deleteVolunteer` command calls `Model#commitVolunCHeer()`, causing the modified state of the VolunCHeer book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `VolunCHeerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted VolunCHeer book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new volunteer. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitVolunCHeer()`, causing another modified VolunCHeer book state to be saved into the `VolunCHeerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitVolunCHeer()`, so the VolunCHeer book state will not be saved into the `VolunCHeerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the volunteer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoVolunCHeer()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous VolunCHeer book state, and restores the VolunCHeer book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial VolunCHeer book state, then there are no previous VolunCHeer book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoVolunCHeer()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoVolunCHeer()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the VolunCHeer book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `VolunCHeerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest VolunCHeer book state, then there are no undone VolunCHeer book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoVolunCHeer()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the VolunCHeer book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitVolunCHeer()`, `Model#undoVolunCHeer()` or `Model#redoVolunCHeer()`. Thus, the `VolunCHeerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitVolunCHeer()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `VolunCHeerStateList`, all VolunCHeer book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

[width="100%", cols="1, 1, 1 "options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Aspect | Alternatives | Pros (+)/ Cons(-)
.2+| How undo & redo executes
| *Saves the entire VolunCHeer book.*
| + : Easy to implement. +
    {empty} +
 - :  May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
| Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
| + : Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteVolunteer`, just save the volunteer being deleted).
    {empty} +
  - : We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

.2+| Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
| *Use a list to store the history of VolunCHeer book states.*
| + : Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.+
    {empty} +
 - : Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedVolunCHeer`.

| Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
| + : We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
  {empty} +
  - : Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::projectcalendar[]
=== [Proposed] Project Calendar

_{The projectcalendar mechanism takes the projectTitle and projectDate attribute of the project list and apply them into - Google Calendar API such that the UI now
 includes a calendar interface and projects sorted according to date.
 The API has a dependency on Google API Client Library and build.gradle file compiles 'com.google.api-client:google-api-client:1.25.0'.

// tag::deleteProject[]
=== [Proposed] Delete Project

_{The deleteProject is facilitated by DeleterProjectCommand Parser. deleteProject(index) removes the project with index, alongside with date attribute but beneficiary remains.
if the project index is not found, DeleteProjectCommand throws ParseException.

// end::deleteProject[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.VolunCHeer.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.VolunCHeer.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.VolunCHeer.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.VolunCHeer.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/VolunCHeer/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, VolunCHeer Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
