== Introduction

Hello and welcome to VolunCHeer! VolunCheer is a desktop application for project managers who want *an easy way to keep
track of their beneficiaries, volunteers, and any ongoing / upcoming projects.*

VolunCheer is optimised for users who prefer a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still being able to view important
data on the *Graphical User Interface(GUI)*. If that suits your tastes come give it a try!

We guarantee that VolunCHeer will save you the need for multiple documents and folders just to store
all your information. And with our ability to *filter out suitable volunteers based on their data*,
you can effectively say goodbye to more cumbersome sorting methods like Excel!

Eager to get started? Click on link:{https://github.com/cs2113-ay1819s2-t08-1/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#quick-start}/[Section 2. "Quick Start"] to jump ahead,
though we highly recommend reading the overview below!

=== Overview
To facilitate your reading, we have a few icons to take note of:

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`help`* : get a list of all the commands we have (highly recommended).
* **`addProject`** n/Project Sunshine d/20190320: adds a project named "Project Sunshine" in the project list.
* **`deleteProject`**`2` : deletes the 2nd project portfolio in the current list of projects.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  For a more detailed explanation of each command please refer to <<Features>>  .

[[Features]]
== Features
Before we go on to explain our features, this section will give a brief introduction
on how to interpret our explanations.
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which you supply, like `add n/John Doe`. Parameters
are generally necessary, unless mentioned as below.
* Parameters in square brackets are *optional* e.g in `addVolunteer n/NAME [t/TAG]`, we can input `addVolunteer n/John Doe t/friend` or `addVolunteer n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, including zero. e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), or  `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also perfectly acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`
If you are stuck and cannot figure out what to do, do not fear! Instead of screaming for help, simply type it into the command bar and we will give you
everything you need to use this app.

Format: `help`

// tag::ProjectManagement[]
=== Project Management

==== Adding a project: `addProject` / `ap`
One of the first things to do when you use the app is to start adding projects to track, and this is the command to use.

Format: `addProject n/PROJECT_NAME d/DATE`

****
* Please enter DATE in DD/MM/YYYY format, making sure that the date should be after today.
* Project Name does not accept duplicates in the project list, so make you name everything differently!
* Projects are automatically sorted in ascending date order for easier tracking or Project tasks.
****

Now let us look at what happens when the command `addProject p/Old Folk Home Visit d/25/05/2019` is entered on screen.

.When `addProject p/Old Folk Home Visit d/25/05/2019` is executed.
image::addProject.png[]


==== Deleting a project ： `deleteProject` / `dp`
When a project is completed or cancelled, VolunCHeer allows you to easily delete it by stating
 the project order in the list. +
Format: `deleteProject INDEX`

****
* This INDEX refers to the index of the project in the project list. If you are unsure of the order, *PLEASE*
  use 'listProject' to view all projects and get the correct index. If you delete the wrong projects, please refer to  <<undo>>.
* Error message is shown if the INDEX entered is invalid
****

This is how the project list changes upon execution.

.When `deleteProject 3` command is executed.

image::deleteProject.png[]

==== Listing all projects : `listProject` / `lp`

When you want to take a look at all your projects, this command helps you do so. +

Format: `listProject`

==== Assigning a Beneficiary to Project: `assignB`
Projects are generally associated with certain beneficiaries. VolunCHeer allows you to attach them easily with this command.
It assigns the Beneficiary at the provided INDEX to the Project with ProjectTitle indicated. +

Format: `assignBeneficiary p/PROJECT_TITLE i/INDEX`

****
* The assigned Beneficiary can then be seen under the Project card as shown below.
* There can be only one beneficiary for each project, however, one beneficiary can be assigned to multiple projects.
****

[IMPORTANT]
The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`

After assigning a beneficiary, the project will have its adata updated as seen below.

.When `assignB p/Old Folks Home Visit i/1` command executed
image::assignB.png[]

[TIP]
Use listBeneficiary to view a full list of Beneficiary to assign.
Use summaryBeneficiary command to view the Projects attached to each Beneficiary.

==== Assigning one or more Volunteers to Project: `assignV`
We also provide an easy method to assign a specific number of volunteers to the indicated Project


Format: `assignVolunteer p/PROJECT_TITLE rv/REQUIRED_NUMBER_OF_VOLUNTEERS`


[TIP]
The number of volunteers assigned to the Project can be seen under the Project card as shown below.


.When `assignV p/Old Folks Home Visit rv/2` is executed.

image::assignV.png[]

[TIP]
Use the commands listed in <<map>> to filter out the desired list of volunteers.

==== Mark project as complete: 'complete'
Once a project is done, you can mark it as complete to distinguish it from your other projects.
Simply provide an INDEX to indicate which project you would like to complete.

Format: `complete i/INDEX`

.When `complete i/1` command is executed

image::complete.png[]

[NOTE]
Once marked as complete, project title will be displayed in red colour font

// end::ProjectManagement[]

// tag::BeneficiaryManagement[]
=== Beneficiary Management


==== Adding a beneficiary: `addBeneficiary` / `ab`
Similar to the previous adding command, this adds a beneficiary to the list of Beneficiaries +

Format: `addBeneficiary n/NAME a/ADDRESS e/EMAIL p/PHONE_NUMBER`

Example:

* `addBeneficiary n/Orphanage p/98765432 e/Orphanage@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`

.Add Beneficiary Command Result (pink: input, blue: output)
image::AddBeneficiary.png[]

In the figure above, after the add command, we can observe a new beneficiary card is shown on the GUI.

****
* The beneficiary will be used to assign to a project, this means that the project will benefit this beneficiary,
i.e. Orphanage Home, Nursing home, etc.
* When add a new beneficiary, the project lists assigned to it will be empty. You can assign projects to it by assign
command stated.
****


==== Editing a beneficiary: `editBeneficiary` / `eb`
In case of incorrect information, we also allow you to edit the beneficiary at the given INDEX

Format: `editBeneficiary  INDEX (must be a positive integer) [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]`

Examples:

* `editBeneficiary 1 n/Old Folk Home p/91234567`

.Edit Beneficiary Command Result (pink: input, blue: output)
image::EditBeneficiary.png[]

In the figure, we can see that the WHO information including phone number and email has changed, compared to the last figure.

[NOTE]
When a beneficiary is edited, the data of the beneficiary in its attached projects is in sync, meaning that that data
is automatically updated in the mentioned projects.


==== Deleting a beneficiary: `deleteBeneficiary` / `db`
Of course, once a beneficiary is no longer associated with you, it can be removed by providing the INDEX.

Format: `deleteBeneficiary i/INDEX -D`

[IMPORTANT]
`-D` is optional and should not be misused (see below)

****
* There are two modes of deletion: *soft delete mode* and *hard delete mode*. +
* In the *soft delete mode*, there is a safe check to help you avoid deleting beneficiary
that has attached projects, leaving the projects unassigned.
* In the *hard delete mode*,
the beneficiary and all its attached projects will be deleted. +
* Default is *soft delete mode*. To switch to *hard delete mode*, include `-D` in your command.
****

Examples:

* `deleteBeneficiary i/1`  *soft delete mode*
* `deleteBeneficiary i/1 -D`  *hard delete mode*

.Delete Beneficiary Command (Soft Delete Mode) Result (pink: input, blue: output)
image::SoftDelete.png[]

In Figure 3, we are trying to soft delete a beneficiary which was assigned to project *Run*. Hence, a message appears and informs us
to switch to hard delete mode.

.Delete Beneficiary Command (Hard Delete Mode) Result (pink: input, blue: output)
image::HardDelete.png[]

In Figure 4, the beneficiary and its attached projects have been deleted successfully.

==== Listing all beneficiaries: `listBeneficiary` / `lb`

As before, you can show a list of all Beneficiaries in the beneficiary pool.

Format: `listBeneficiary`

[TIP]
The command can be used to get back to full list after several commands which change the list.

==== Locating beneficiaries by name: `findBeneficiary` / `fb`
TO facilitate searching for beneficiary, you can locate a specific one easily with via given keyword/keywords.

Format: `findBeneficiary KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `orphanage` will match `Orphanage`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Orphanage Nursing` will match `Nursing Orphanage`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Orphan` will not match `Orphanage`
* beneficiaries matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Orphanage Nursing` will return
 `Orphanage Rainbow` and `Nursing Home`
****

Examples:

* `find Nursing` +
Returns `Nursing Home` and `Nursing Center`

==== Summarising all beneficiaries: `summariseBeneficiary` / `sb`
Sometimes we have a beneficiary assigned to many projects and we just want to see a list of everything it is attached to.
This command opens a pop up summary table of the beneficiaries for easy view. You can use even the arrow in header cells *number of Projects*
to sort beneficiaries by the number of attached projects.

Format: `summariseBeneficiary`

.Beneficiary Summary Table
image::SummaryBeneficiary.png[]

[TIP]
The command can be used to consider future partners or fundraising.
// end::BeneficiaryManagement[]

// tag::VolunteerManagement[]
=== Volunteer

==== Adding a volunteer: `addVolunteer` / `av`

As like before, this adds a volunteer to the volunteer pool

Format: `addVolunteer n/NAME y/AGE g/GENDER r/RACE [rg/RELIGION] a/ADDRESS e/EMAIL p/PHONE_NUMBER
ec/EMERGENCY_CONTACT [dp/DIETARY_PREFERENCE] [m/MEDICAL_CONDITION] [t/TAG]...`

Alternative Format: `av n/NAME y/AGE g/GENDER r/RACE [rg/RELIGION] a/ADDRESS e/EMAIL p/PHONE_NUMBER
                    ec/EMERGENCY_CONTACT [dp/DIETARY_PREFERENCE] [m/MEDICAL_CONDITION] [t/TAG]...`

****
* "Add Successful!" message is prompted upon successfully adding a volunteer
* An invalid message will be prompted if a Volunteer with the same exact name is present in the existing database
* Parameters for Religion, Dietary Preference, Medical Condition are optional and set to 'nil' by default
****

[TIP]
A volunteer can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `addVolunteer n/John Doe y/18 g/male r/eurasian rg/christian a/John street, block 123, #01-01 e/johnd@example.com
p/98765432 ec/Mary, Mother, 92221111 dp/vegetarian m/asthma`

* `av n/Sarah Soh y/22 g/female r/chinese rg/buddhist a/betsy ave 6, 02-08 e/sarah08@example.com
p/92345678 ec/Johnny, Husband, 81234568`

==== Deleting a volunteer : `deleteVolunteer` \ `dv`
After a volunteer has left, it can be deleted by this command by referencing its index in the list.

Format: `deleteVolunteer INDEX` +
Alternative Format: `dv INDEX`

****
* Deletes the volunteer at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed volunteer list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Error message is shown if the given index is invalid
****

Examples:

* `listVolunteer` +
`deleteVolunteer 2` +
Deletes the 2nd volunteer in the volunteer list.
* `findVolunteer Betsy` +
`dv 1` +
Deletes the 1st volunteer in the searched volunteer list.

[TIP]
Use the list volunteers commands to check the correct index of the volunteer to be deleted

==== Editing a volunteer : `editVolunteer` \ `ev`
Similar to beneficiary, we can update volunteer particulars by the given index.

Format: `editVolunteer INDEX [n/NAME] [y/AGE] [g/GENDER] [r/RACE] [rg/RELIGION][p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL]
[ec/EMERGENCYCONTACT] [dp/DIETARYPREFERENCE] [mc/MEDICALCONDITION] [t/TAG]...`

Alternative Format: `ev INDEX [n/NAME] [y/AGE] [g/GENDER] [r/RACE] [rg/RELIGION][p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL]
                    [ec/EMERGENCYCONTACT] [dp/DIETARYPREFERENCE] [mc/MEDICALCONDITION] [t/TAG]...`
****
* Edits the volunteer at the specified `INDEX`.
The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed volunteer list.
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the volunteer will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the volunteer's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `editVolunteer 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st volunteer to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `ev 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd volunteer to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

==== Locating volunteers by name: `findVolunteer` \ `fv`
Searching for volunteers works similarly to beneficiaries.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Alternative Format: `fv KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* volunteers matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
* e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

Examples:

* `findVolunteer John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `fv Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any volunteer having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`

==== Listing all volunteers : `listVolunteer` \ `lv`
Shows a list of all volunteers in the volunteer pool. +

Format: `listVolunteer`

Alternative Format: `lv`
// end::VolunteerManagement[]

[[map]]
// tag::FilteredExport[]
=== Filtering & Exporting

==== Assigning mapping index to each volunteer : `map`
We know that some volunteers suit a certain project better than others. To help with finding these volunteers,
the map command assigns the volunteers with points 3, 2 or 1 according to the selection criteria that you set.


Format: `map t/(POINTS)(CRITERIA) t/(POINTS)(CRITERIA) t/(POINTS)(CRITERIA)`

****
* The t/ refers to any of the following tags.
* There are three types of tags, the age of volunteer (y/), race (r/) and medical condition (m/).
* You can enter at most 3 tags and at least 1 tag as the selection criteria.
* Each volunteer is internally assigned points which will be used used for sorting later on.
* The age criteria has comparators >,<,= which relate to the age given afterwards.
* See examples below for a clearer picture.
****

Examples:

* `map y/3>18 r/2chinese m/1NIL`
Gives volunteers above the AGE of 18 3 points, RACE chinese 2 points and MEDICAL_CONDITION of NIL 1 point.
* `map m/3NIL`
Only gives volunteers with no MEDICAL_CONDITION 3 points.

.map command execution
image::MapCommand.png[]

Upon executing a successful map command, the message on figure 12 will appear.

==== Sorting volunteers according to points : `sort`
After mapping, we can then sort the volunteers into order, with the most suitable volunteers being on top.

Format: `sort`

****
* The map function should be called before sort to generate the points
* Volunteers with equal points will not be sorted in any particular order
* Selection of the volunteers, such as with the assignV command, can be done after sorting.
****

.Before sorting
image::SortBefore.jpg[]
.After sorting
image::SortAfter.jpg[]

As can be seen in figure 13 Alice was previously at index 3. After sorting, she has shifted up to index 2 in figure 14.

==== Extracting multiple volunteers from sorted list : `extract`
Not everyone will have VolunCHeer, which is frankly their loss. Nonetheless, this command allows you
share a list of certain volunteer particulars by extracting it into a Microsoft Excel file.

Format: `extract NUMBER_OF_VOLUNTEERS t/PARTICULAR [t/OTHER_PARTICULARS]...`

****
* This command requires at least one type of particular from the volunteers, up to all type of particulars.
* If the NUMBER_OF_VOLUNTEERS exceeds the total number of volunteers in the list, the file will just extract all volunteers in
VolunCHeer.
* This command can be called before map and sort if order is not an issue.
****

Examples:

*`extract [1][20]`
Extracts the first 20 volunteers in the sorted list.
*`extract [5][15]`
Extracts volunteer number 5 to 15 in the list.

.Extracted volunteer details
image::Export.png[]

The Excel file will look like figure 15.
// end::FilteredExport[]

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
[[undo]]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the VolunCHeer application to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the VolunCHeer application's main content (`addProject`, `addVolunteer`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.
