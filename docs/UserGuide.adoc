== Introduction

VolunCHeer is a desktop application for project managers who wish to keep track of their ongoing / upcoming projects as
well as their beneficiary and volunteer pool.

You can also use VolunCHeer to filter out suitable volunteers based on their data stored in the system. VolunCHeer is
The VolunCHeer Application is for project managers or directors who require a system to *keep track of their
ongoing projects and the volunteer pool*. VolunCHeer is optimised for users who prefer a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while
still being able to view important data on the *Graphical User Interface(GUI)*. VolunCHeer will save you the need for multiple documents
and folders just to store volunteer/beneficiary information. It also removes the need to track large amount of volunteer data to fit selection criterias using traditional methods such
as Excel.
